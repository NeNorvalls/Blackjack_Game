## JavaScript Approach

The JavaScript code follows a modular approach to ensure readability and maintainability:

- **Object-Oriented**: The game logic is encapsulated within functions and objects.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Different functions handle specific tasks such as dealing cards, calculating scores, and determining the winner.
- **Consistent Naming**: Variables and functions are named descriptively to enhance understanding.

By following these principles, the JavaScript code remains concise, clear, and easy to understand, facilitating future updates and modifications.
